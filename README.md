# Simple chatbot implementation

A chatbot implementation in python using deep learning techniques.

The dataset contains catoegories (intents), their patterns and the appropriate responses. A special recurrent neural network (LSTM) is used to classify the category the user's message belongs to and then a random response is given out from the list of responses. Libraries used: keras, tensorflow, nltk, pickle

A simple GUI is created using Tkinter library for taking inputs and displaying outputs of the chatbot.
